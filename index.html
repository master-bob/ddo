        <h3>What is Digital Drop-Off?</h3>
        <p>
          Digital Drop-Off (DDO) is a new tool in development at the University of Dayton that allows students to share documents with a department or group in Sakai independent of a course or project site. This new tool will serve as the foundation for an online writing support center built for Sakai. Once completed, this multi-phase project will provide institutions using Sakai with a suite of tools for establishing fully online writing support. Phase 1, the 1.0 release of the DDO tool, is scheduled to be completed in January 2016.

        <h3>Student Experience: Dropping Off a Document</h3>
        <p>
          When students login to Sakai and navigate to DDO in their My Workspace site they will be met with a simple page explaining the expectations for using the DDO service. Additionally, on this page is a table of their previous submissions, a small box showing the number of waiting submissions, and a large green button that begins the drop off process.
          <br />
          Below you will find a video that details what the student experiences when they drop off a document for review.

        <h3>Staff Experience: Reviewing a Document</h3>
        <p>
          When a writing consultant (DDO staff member) navigates to DDO they will see the same overview page as the student. However, there will now be an extra page available titled "Staff." A DDO staff member can navigate to this page to review documents that have been dropped off. On the staff page they will see two tables. One lists the submissions that are still waiting to be reviewed and another that shows the completed reviews.
          <br />
          Below you will find a brief video that shows the review process for a DDO staff member.

        <h3>Student Experience: Viewing Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          Once a document has been reviewed and returned to the submitter. That student will have a "View Feedback" link available next to the corresponding submission. Here, the student will see their submission for reference along with any feedback that was provided by the DDO staff member.
          <br />
          This last video quickly runs through how a student views feedback once a submission has been reviewed.
